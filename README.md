RecipEat

Project Description:
In this application we will be asking the user to input ingredients and based off of the users input four recipes will appear per search to the right side of the window. Any additional new searches will be added to the window. The users ingredient search history is also saved to local storage and displays on the page under previously searched. The application also utilizes two different API's, the main one being Edamam for recipe searches and Spoonacular for ingredient substitution searches.

Technologies Used:
- CSS framework: Bulma
- API's: Edamam, Spoonacular
- Javascript, HTML
